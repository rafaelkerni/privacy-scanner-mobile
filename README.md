# Privacy Scanner — WiFi Surveillance Device Detector

A Claude Code skill that scans WiFi networks to detect hidden cameras and surveillance devices in rental accommodations (Airbnb, Booking, VRBO, etc.).

**Cross-platform**: Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Cross-platform (Python — recommended)
sudo python3 scripts/scan.py           # Linux / macOS
python scripts\scan.py                  # Windows (Admin PowerShell)

# Linux-only (Bash)
sudo bash scripts/scan.sh
```

## Prerequisites

### All platforms: nmap (mandatory) + Python 3.8+

| Platform | nmap | Python | Extras |
|----------|------|--------|--------|
| **Linux (Arch)** | `sudo pacman -S nmap` | `sudo pacman -S python` | `arp-scan avahi` (recommended) |
| **Linux (Debian)** | `sudo apt install nmap` | `sudo apt install python3` | `arp-scan avahi-utils` |
| **macOS** | `brew install nmap` | `brew install python` | `arp-scan` (recommended) |
| **Windows** | [nmap.org/download](https://nmap.org/download) (includes Npcap) | [python.org](https://python.org) | — |

### Python packages (optional, improve detection)

```bash
pip install python-nmap zeroconf requests
# or
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Without these packages, the scanner still works using nmap subprocess calls. With them, you get better mDNS discovery and HTTP inspection.

## Usage

```bash
# Full auto-detect (Portuguese report by default)
sudo python3 scripts/scan.py

# Report in English or Spanish
sudo python3 scripts/scan.py --lang en
sudo python3 scripts/scan.py --lang es

# Quick mode (skip service discovery & deep inspection)
sudo python3 scripts/scan.py --quick

# Specify WiFi interface or subnet
sudo python3 scripts/scan.py --interface wlan0
sudo python3 scripts/scan.py --subnet 192.168.1.0/24

# Custom output directory
sudo python3 scripts/scan.py --output-dir /tmp/my-scan

# Skip HTML report
sudo python3 scripts/scan.py --no-html

# Show help
python3 scripts/scan.py --help
```

### Windows (Admin PowerShell)

```powershell
python scripts\scan.py
python scripts\scan.py --quick --lang en
```

## What It Scans

**7-Phase Pipeline:**

1. **Host Discovery** — Find all devices via ARP scan + nmap ping scan
2. **OUI Analysis** — Identify manufacturers from MAC addresses, flag camera brands
3. **Port Scan** — Check 20 camera-specific ports (RTSP, HTTP, vendor-proprietary)
4. **Service Discovery** — mDNS/Bonjour, UPnP/SSDP, ONVIF WS-Discovery
5. **Deep Inspection** — HTTP banner grabbing, RTSP verification, keyword analysis
6. **Risk Classification** — Correlate all evidence into risk levels
7. **Report** — Terminal output + HTML report

## Risk Levels

| Level | Meaning | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 🔴 CRITICAL | Confirmed camera/streaming | Hikvision device with RTSP port open |
| 🟠 HIGH | Strong camera indicators | Wyze MAC address detected |
| 🟡 MODERATE | Suspicious/unidentified | Unknown device with HTTP server |
| 🟢 LOW | Probably safe | ESP32 device without camera ports |
| 🔵 INFO | Known safe | iPhone, laptop, printer |

## Output

- **Terminal**: Color-coded real-time output with risk-classified device list
- **HTML Report**: `./privacy-scan-results/privacy-scan-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.html`
  - Dark security-themed UI with animated scanning elements
  - Interactive device cards (click to expand, copy IP/MAC)
  - Live language switcher (PT / EN / ES) — no reload needed
  - Print-friendly mode (Ctrl+P)
  - Fully self-contained — works offline, no external dependencies
- **Raw Data**: `./privacy-scan-results/raw-data-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/`

## Limitations

This tool scans WiFi-connected devices only. It **cannot** detect:

- Cameras on a separate VLAN or wired-only network
- Cellular-connected cameras (4G/LTE)
- Cameras that are powered off
- Devices using MAC address randomization
- Local-storage cameras not connected to any network
- Audio-only recording devices (bugs)

**Always complement with a physical inspection.**

## Rental Platform Policies

> Airbnb prohibits ALL indoor cameras and recording devices, even if disclosed and turned off. Outdoor cameras must be disclosed. Audio recording is prohibited everywhere. Other platforms (Booking, VRBO) have similar policies.

## If You Find a Camera

1. Do NOT disconnect or tamper with it
2. Photograph the device and its location
3. Save the scan report as evidence
4. Contact Airbnb: App → Your Trips → Get Help → Report a safety concern
5. Airbnb Emergency: +1-855-424-7262
6. Leave if you feel unsafe
7. Consider contacting local law enforcement
